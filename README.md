## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

* eslint: ^7.28.0
* eslint-config-airbnb: ^18.2.1
* moment: ^2.29.1

## Comments & considerations

* UI based on <a href="https://zpl.io/2vJKgqQ" target="_blank">Zeplin's shared project</a>.
* The developed UI is responsive and based on the design's base resolution, which is 1440x1024 pixels.
* No UI framework was used, HTML/CSS only for building UI components.
* CSS Modules were used to apply components styles.
* Used style breakpoints are 1280px and 960px.
* Preferred using SVG than PNG to ensure there's no pixelation on icons (except the ones on the dropdown, since they are not provided on Zeplin).
* News dropdown selector was made from scratch to ensure design fidelity on all devices.
* Used Airbnb JS Style Guide (ESLint rules, including ECMAScript 6+ and React).
* Only two libraries were used (axios to fetch API data, and moment.js to format the news publication elapsed time.)
* News are stacked in columns instead of rows based on Zeplin's project "Faves" view (there are only 5 items on the second page, 4 in the first column plus 1 in the second column).
* Considering that I'm using server-side pagination and that I'm only keeping data with the indicated attributes (author, story_title, story_url, created_at) there are some pages that might not have all 8 blocks of news, like in the previously mentioned "Faves" view. I assumed it was supposed to work like this so that we could ensure consistency using the "page" parameter for pagination.
* For mobile and other low resolutions where scrolling is needed in order to use the pagination, I added an automatic smooth scroll all the way to the top when the page number buttons are pressed, that way there's a more natural UX of scrolling or swiping down to consume the website's content.
* Skeleton for the news blocks were added to give the user a feedback using loading states.
* Used React Context API to handle global states, and localStorage for a more persistent storage, as indicated.
* I applied the opacity on hover to the whole row using one single selector (instead of applying it to all its children). I wanted to be as loyal as possible to the provided design, and applying the opacity to the children doesn't affect the border-color, and it can lead to multiple overlapping layers of opacity.
* I tried placing the "like" gray block under the text block for the mobile versions, but it was more difficult to scroll and press it with one hand, so I kept the desktop distribution (text block on the left, like button on the right).

## Opportunity areas

* Hover on "like" buttons could actually fill the heart icon before pressing it.
* Animations and transitions to certain UI items (like fade in/out to show/hide the dropdown, or animate borders when switching tabs).
* Hover on rows could have a different behaviour, since applying opacity is not very intuitive for a call-to-action. 
* UX related improvements.
